The dataset includes the whole manufacturing process for digging of gravel round and sand (no crushed gravel), internal processes (transport, etc.),  infrastructure for the operation (machinery) and land-use of the mine (incl. unpaved roads). The dataset doesn't include the land-use of the paved roads and buildings, the administration, dust emissions (because it is mostly a 'wet' process) and wastewater (because process water is not polluted -only sand and gravel- and therefore directly seeped).</includedActivitiesEnd>

        <productionVolumeComment xml:lang="en">Estimated value. Information regarding production volume and mining technology for sand and aggregates is very scarce (Peduzzia, et al. 2014). It is estimated that around 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel are mined each year (WWF, 2018).
According to the WWF (2018), the demand of sand and aggregated in general has and is increasing, the demand comes in particular from developing countries, for example, “China consumed more sand between 2011-2013 than the US did in the whole of the 20th Century.”. This has contributed to the, today’s significant, illegal sand market. Most of illegal sand comes from rivers and coastal areas (WWF 2018; The Third Pole, 2017). Lai et al. (2014) report the estimated amount of sand mined from the biggest sand mine in the world, the Poyang Lake, China. The estimate is of 448 billion kg of sand (De Leeuw 2010). As a frame of reference, the country of Brazil as whole mines 266 billion kg of sand per year.
The demand of sand has also increased in the US in the past 15 years as the it was found that sand could be used in fracking in order to increase yield (Edwards, 2015). Sand is also used by cities to enlarge their territory “517 million metric tons of sand in the past 20 years” (Edwards, 2015) citing UNEP (2014). 
Of the estimated 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel, it is assumed that 35% is sand, following ecoinvent v2 report 7. This results in 17.5 billion tonnes. Double check with Tweedie (2018), which reports a world consumption of sand between 15 and 20 billion tonnes, and Peduzzia, P. et al. (2014). The production of gravel is therefore set to 50*0.65 billion tonnes. Of which 85% is considered to be gravel, round and 15% is considered to be crushed (see general comment of the activity “gravel production, gravel, CH” in date 12th October 2018).
No information was found regarding the technologies used for sand mining. The WWF (2018) refers to Europe as the region where no sand is mined from rivers. On the other hand we know that 70% of sand mined in Brazil comes from rivers (see the dataset “sand quarry operation, extraction from river bed, BR, in date 12th October 2012). Some report quarry as the most prominent mining technology (n.d. 2017), others highlight how the growing illegal market source sand from rivers and coastal areas. ecoinvent does not report data regarding illegal mining. It is therefore estimated that 70% of sand is produced via quarry.
For Switzerland only quarry mine is included. The production volume is scaled from the Global based on cement production. Swiss cement production is estimated to be 1.22 million tons (Global Cement, 2018), the Global is estimated to be 4.6 billion tonnes (Cembureau, 2016) . Switzerland is therefore 0.00026 of Global.

The machines used for the mining of sand and gravel are considered: 3 sieves (assuming each 5t), 5 'small' silos (assuming each 7t), 1 barrel washer (20 t) and other machines (30t). The total weight of the machines considered is 100 t. The service life of all these machines is assumed to be 25 years. The part of the machines which belongs to the mining process itself is included in the module 'gravel/sand mine'. Wearing parts and lubricating oil is taken into account. The total amount of material treated by these machines over 25 years is therefore about 743.75 Mio tons.
