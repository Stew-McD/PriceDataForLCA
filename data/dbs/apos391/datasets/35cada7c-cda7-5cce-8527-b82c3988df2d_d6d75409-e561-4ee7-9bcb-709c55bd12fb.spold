          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This is a market activity. Each market represents the consumption mix of a product in a given geography, connecting suppliers with consumers of the same product in the same geographical area. Markets group the producers and also the imports of the product (if relevant) within the same geographical area. They also account for transport to the consumer and for the losses during that process, when relevant. </text>

Only the total Fe in the tailings is considered here, meaning that the content of FeO in the tailings that is reported in the abovementioned publication (as one part of the total iron content) has been omitted to avoid double counting. However the oxygen content of the FeO has been considered in the calculation of oxygen content. FeO content in the tailings is 2.38%. Subtotal masses of FeO are: Fe:77.74%, O:22.27% (see property comment of oxygen).

The calculation of the individual contents of each compound in the tailings is based on the subtotal masses of the elements in each compound. The subtotal masses are calculated using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm). The content of SiO2 in the tailings is: 33.26%. The subtotal masses of SiO2 are: Si:46.75%, O:53.26%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.
