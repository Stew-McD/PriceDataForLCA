        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents a reservoir hydro power plant unit for non-alpine regions. Due to the fact that this dataset is based on data of Swiss dams and then extrapolated to non-alpine regions, the uncertainty is increased. Non-alpine regions are considered to be represented by all European countries using hydropower and modelled in ecoinvent except from Austria, Italy, France and Finland. A representative sample of various types of dams in Switzerland is taken into account, i.e. 52 reservoir power plants with an annual gross production output of 17.8 TWh and an installed capacity of 9130 MW.  As far as the construction is concerned, reservoir power plants and pumped storage power plants are dealt with together due to the fact that the construction efforts are related. Lifetime is assumed to be 150 years for the dam and 80 years for the rest of materials. The data refers to plant construction of a mix of types of dams built between 1945 and 1970; therefore they might not be representative for more modern construction, for an individual type and for small-scale and smallest-scale plants.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">Storage power plants have an appendant reservoir. The size of the reservoir can range from daily, monthly to annual storage reservoirs. According to the net head high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure systems can be distinguished. High- and medium-pressure systems are constructed as dams. High-pressure storage power plants with a head of over 50 meters are very common in Switzerland. For this dataset concrete dams (arch dams and gravity dams) with a height of more then 30 meters are taken into account. Also pumped storage power plants are included because in most cases the data is only available for the overall generation system. The same counts for high- and medium-pressure and alpine run-of-river power plants which are also included in the storage power plant dataset. Due to the fact that the efforts for the plant construction are similar to storage power plants and that the estimated production is comparatively low, high- and medium-pressure run-of-river power plants are covered by the reservoir power station dataset.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">The technology used in the dataset has an overall efficiency of 82%, more modern technologies show an overall efficiency of about 88%. The overall efficiency is composed of the efficiency of the works water channel, the turbine, the generator and the transformer and are listed below:</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="13">The losses along the works water channel are primarily caused by friction and are calculated from the difference between gross and net head. Based on this calculation the efficiency of the works water channel amounts to 95%. The losses depend on the flow rate and have its maximum at full load. The smaller the cross section of adits and pressure pipelines, the higher the flow velocity and thus the friction losses. In older plants according to Bischof (1992) the efficiency of works water channels could be increased generally more than by replacing turbines and generators.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="14">None</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="15">The efficiency losses in turbines depend on the turbine type (Kaplan, Francis, Pelton, etc.), the turbine output and on the ratio between turbined water amount and the rated water amount. In König (1997) examples for curve progressions of the relationship between these variables are shown. For current power plants an efficiency of 87% is assumed, more modern turbines show an efficiency of about 91%.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="16">None</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="17">The efficiency of generators depends on the output, the rotation speed of the generator and the cooling system. Some relevant data can be found in König (1997). For today’s power plants an efficiency of approximately 96% is assumed, modern generators show an efficiency of about 98%. The efficiency of transformers amounts to 98%, respectively 99%.</text>

Calculated Value. Data regarding material consumption for infrastructure are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. For reservoir power plants built in other European countries than Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland an uncertainty factor of 3 is assumed. This is due to the fact that major differences in hydrological and geological conditions, construction technology and landscape can occur. 

In addition to the aggregates (sand, gravel and water) the quantitatively most important building material in hydro power plants is cement. Cement is used for: dams (most striking), grouting, adits, surge tanks, water catchment, river engineering, equalizing reservoirs, power stations, transport cable railways or residential buildings for personnel.

The calculation of cement consumption is based on data of 52 Swiss power plants and on literature. Where no literature was available, the following assumptions were made: 
- arch dams need more higher dosed face concrete, due to the slim design; a ratio of 2/3 face concrete and 1/3 mass concrete is assumed
- gravity dams are composed of a large amount of mass concrete and less face concrete, hence a ratio of 1/3 face concrete and 2/3 mass concrete is assumed

Cement for dams was calculated from dam volume and average cement content, respectively from mean value of 230 kg/m3 if data was missing. Where no data was available, the total amount of cement was calculated from the amount of cement for dams and the mean value of the ratio of cement for dams and total amount of cement. The cement for dam’s share of the total amount of cement ranges between 60% and 90% with a mean value of 71%.

Average cement consumption varies between 172 and 294 kg/m3 with an arithmetic average of 230 kg/m3. Specific cement consumption varies between 0.05 and 0.96 kg/(kWh/a) with an arithmetic average of 0.39 kg/(kWh/a) per plant. A weighted average of 0.45kg (kWh/a) is calculated from total amount of cement of all plants divided by total net production of all plants. For the calculation of the specific cement consumption the weighted average is used because this figure best represents an average reservoir hydro power station. With an average life time of 150 years for dams and 100 years for adits a specific cement consumption of 3.26 g/kWh distributed over the overall life time is estimated. The total cement consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 8.97. 10^9 kg/unit.

Specific cement consumption varies between 0.05 and 0.96 kg/(kWh/a) with an arithmetic average of 0.39 kg/(kWh/a) per plant. A weighted average of 0.45kg (kWh/a) is calculated from total amount of cement of all plants divided by total net production of all plants. For the calculation of the specific cement consumption the weighted average is used because this figure best represents an average reservoir hydro power station. With an average life time of 150 years for dams and 100 years for adits a specific cement consumption of 3.26 g/kWh distributed over the overall life time is estimated. The total cement consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 8.97. 10^9 kg/unit.

Calculated Value. Data regarding energy consumption for construction works are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. Due to the fact that there already are large uncertainties regarding data for Swiss power plants, the uncertainty factors were not adopted to European conditions. Where possible more suitable modules were used.

Specific fuel consumption (primarily diesel oil) amounts to approximately 7 g /(kWh/a), weighted over life time (i.e. 150 years) it amounts to 0.047 g/kWh with a net calorific value of 42.8 MJ/kg. The total fuel consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 5.15 . 10^9 MJ/unit

Calculated Value. Electricity for construction work is adapted according to the country-specific UCTE supply modules. Data regarding energy consumption for construction works are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. Due to the fact that there already are large uncertainties regarding data for Swiss power plants, the uncertainty factors were not adopted to European conditions. 

Specific electricity consumption varies between 0.09 und 0.32 kWh/(kWh/a) with a mean value of 0.16 kWh/(kWh/a). Specific electricity consumption weighted over life time (i.e. 150 years) amounts to 0.0011 kWh/kWh.  The total electricity consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 2.82 . 10^9 kWh/unit.

For reservoir power plants built in other European countries than Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland an uncertainty factor of 3 is assumed. This is due to the fact that major differences in hydrological and geological conditions, construction technology and landscape can occur. 

Specific explosive consumption varies between 1.7 and 4.9 g /(kWh/a), with a mean value of 2.9 g/(kWh/a). Average explosive consumption per kg excavated material is between 0.00019 und 0.00049 kg/kg.

For reservoir power plants built in other European countries than Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland an uncertainty factor of 3 is assumed. This is due to the fact that major differences in hydrological and geological conditions, construction technology and landscape can occur. 

Based on data of six power plants and on literature, specific steel consumption of 40g/(kWh/a) with a span of 23-46 g/(kWh/a) is estimated. Reinforcing steel accounts for 25% (i.e. 9-12 g/(kWh/a)). Specific reinforcing steel consumption averaged over life time (i.e. 150 years) amounts to 0.063 g/kWh. The total reinforcing steel consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 1.71 . 10^8 kg/unit.

Data regarding steel consumption is available for the following power plants: Vorderrhein, Bergell, Salanfe, Hinterrhein, Engadin and Linth Limmern

        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated Value. Data regarding material consumption for infrastructure are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. For reservoir power plants built in other European countries than Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland an uncertainty factor of 3 is assumed. This is due to the fact that major differences in hydrological and geological conditions, construction technology and landscape can occur. 

Based on data of six power plants and on literature, specific steel consumption of 40g/(kWh/a) with a span of 23-46 g/(kWh/a) is estimated. Low-alloyed steel accounts for 60% (i.e. 20-27g/(kWh/a)) and is used for armored conduit for rock anchors and pressure tunnels. Specific low-alloyed steel consumption averaged over life time (i.e. 80 years) amounts to 0.03 g/kWh. The total low-alloyed steel consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 7.68. 10^8 kg/unit.

Data regarding steel consumption is available for the following power plants: Vorderrhein, Bergell, Salanfe, Hinterrhein, Engadin and Linth Limmern

Estimation. Data are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. For reservoir power plants built in other European countries than Austria, Italy, France and Switzerland an uncertainty factor of 3 is assumed. This is due to the fact that major differences in hydrological and geological conditions, construction technology and landscape can occur. 

For 1 m3 of concrete 0.8 m3 of gravel, 0.127 m3 of water and 0.073 m3 of cement are mixed. This corresponds to 127 kg of water or 1.63 g water per kWh. The total water consumption for one hydro power plant unit is 4.95. 10^9 kg/unit.

        <comment xml:lang="en">Estimation. According to experts the dams are left in situ after the siltation of the lake i.e. the dams are not transported or demolished. The same counts for the facing of adit systems. Hence what the demolition is concerned, materials (but not transportation) are taken into account. The exchange flow "waste reinforced concrete" includes the disposal of gravel, cement and reinforced steel. It is assumed that the demolition is done with the help of diggers; the dataset does not represent the demolition via blasting. For the disposal of reinforced concrete a value of 9.21. 10^10 kg is assumed.

The steel derived from turbines, generators, transformer, shutoff devices, pressure pipelines etc. can be recycled, steel deriving from reinforcements, armored conduits etc. in the majority of cases is left in situ, i.e. it can be classified as waste. Due to the lack of detailed data, a recycling quota of 0% is assumed.

        <comment xml:lang="en">Estimation. According to experts the dams are left in situ after the siltation of the lake i.e. the dams are not transported or demolished. The same counts for the facing of adit systems. Hence what the demolition is concerned, materials (but not transportation) are taken into account. The exchange flow "waste reinforced concrete" includes the disposal of gravel, cement and reinforced steel. It is assumed that the demolition is done with the help of diggers; the dataset does not represent the demolition via blasting. For the disposal of reinforced concrete a value of 9.21. 10^10 kg is assumed.

The steel derived from turbines, generators, transformer, shutoff devices, pressure pipelines etc. can be recycled, steel deriving from reinforcements, armored conduits etc. in the majority of cases is left in situ, i.e. it can be classified as waste. Due to the lack of detailed data, a recycling quota of 0% is assumed.

        <comment xml:lang="en">Estimation. Data regarding particle emissions are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. Due to the fact that there already are large uncertainties regarding data for Swiss power plants, the uncertainty factors were not adopted to European conditions. Where possible more suitable modules were used.

Particle emissions are generated during rock blasting, excavation of loose rock, dispersion of dust due to the movement of vehicles on non asphaltic building ground and concrete mixing. Due to the lack of information regarding the amount and size distribution of particle emissions, emission data of mining limestone and bauxite is used for the first three aspects. The mining of bauxite causes 1.5 g total suspended particulates (TSP) per kg excavation material (Althaus et al. 2004 „Metals"), the mining of limestone causes 0.16g TSP/kg excavation material (Kellenberger et al. 2005 „Building products"). These figures include both all mining processes and dust formation during reloading processes. The data of limestone mining is used for the size distribution of particle emissions (Kellenberger et al. 2005 „Building products"). For particulates &lt; 2.5 um 5% size distribution is indicated.

The data of two small plants regarding the total volume of excavation material is available (1.6 kg/(kWh/a) and 5.8 kg/(kWh/a).Due to the fact that higher amounts of excavation material in plants with a higher production potential is expected, the weighted mean value of 3.2 kg/(kWh/a) is doubled arbitrarily. For the calculation of particle emissions 6.4 kg (excavation material)/(kWh/a) are estimated. Particle emissions of 0.3 g (TSP)/kg(excavation material) are assumed with a ratio of 90% limestone mining and 10% bauxite mining. Particle emissions caused by the mining process are listed below:

Emissions                   [g/(kWh/a)]	
Total dust TSP	         1.9	
Particles &lt;2.5 um	     0.095	

Further particle emissions are caused during concrete mixing. In (EPA 2002) 0.06kg (TSP)/t concrete for controlled mixing are indicated. The size distribution of particle emissions according to (EPA 1995) for particulates &lt; 2.5 um is 15% or 9 g/t.

With an average concrete consumption of 0.0014 m3/(kWh/a) and a concrete density of  2200 kg/m3 the particle emissions caused by concrete mixing can be calculated:

Emissions               [g/(kWh/a)]	
Total dust TSP	0.185		
Particles &lt;2.5 um	0.028	

The total particle emissions caused by the construction of a hydro power plant (mining and concrete mixing) per kWh and per power plant unit are listed below:

Emissions                 [g/(kWh/a)    emissions [kg/unit]	
Total dust TSP	 2.08	        3.56E7		
Particles &lt;2.5 um	 0.12	        2.47E10

        <comment xml:lang="en">Estimation. Data regarding particle emissions are adopted from the Swiss power plant sample as it stands. Due to the fact that there already are large uncertainties regarding data for Swiss power plants, the uncertainty factors were not adopted to European conditions. Where possible more suitable modules were used.

Particle emissions are generated during rock blasting, excavation of loose rock, dispersion of dust due to the movement of vehicles on non asphaltic building ground and concrete mixing. Due to the lack of information regarding the amount and size distribution of particle emissions, emission data of mining limestone and bauxite is used for the first three aspects. The mining of bauxite causes 1.5 g total suspended particulates (TSP) per kg excavation material (Althaus et al. 2004 „Metals"), the mining of limestone causes 0.16g TSP/kg excavation material (Kellenberger et al. 2005 „Building products"). These figures include both all mining processes and dust formation during reloading processes. The data of limestone mining is used for the size distribution of particle emissions (Kellenberger et al. 2005 „Building products"). For particulates &gt; 2.5 um and &lt; 10 um 25% size distribution is indicated.

The data of two small plants regarding the total volume of excavation material is available (1.6 kg/(kWh/a) and 5.8 kg/(kWh/a).Due to the fact that higher amounts of excavation material in plants with a higher production potential is expected, the weighted mean value of 3.2 kg/(kWh/a) is doubled arbitrarily. For the calculation of particle emissions 6.4 kg (excavation material)/(kWh/a) are estimated. Particle emissions of 0.3 g (TSP)/kg(excavation material) are assumed with a ratio of 90% limestone mining and 10% bauxite mining. Particle emissions caused by the mining process are listed below:

Emissions                 [g/(kWh/a)]	
Total dust TSP	         1.9	
Particles 2.5-10 um	     0.475	

Further particle emissions are caused during concrete mixing. In (EPA 2002) 0.06kg (TSP)/t concrete for controlled mixing are indicated. The size distribution of particle emissions &gt; 2.5 um and &lt; 10 um according to (EPA 1995) is 35 % or 21 g/t.

With an average concrete consumption of 0.0014 m3/(kWh/a) and a concrete density of  2200 kg/m3 the particle emissions caused by concrete mixing can be calculated:

Emissions                 [g/(kWh/a)]	
Total dust TSP	0.185	
Particles 2.5-10 um	0.065	

The total particle emissions caused by the construction of a hydro power plant (mining and concrete mixing) per kWh and per power plant unit are listed below:

Emissions                 [g/(kWh/a)    emissions [kg/unit]	
Total dust TSP	 2.08	      3.56E7		
Particles 2.5-10 um	 0.54	      1.01E7
