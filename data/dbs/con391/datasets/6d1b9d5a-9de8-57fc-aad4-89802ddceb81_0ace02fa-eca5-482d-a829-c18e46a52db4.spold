        <includedActivitiesStart xml:lang="en">The scope of this dataset is the operation of the locomotive and wagon train, with inputs of locomotives, goods wagons and railway track (covering their production, maintenance and disposal). The transportation service starts with the demand for diesel and the construction of locomotive, goods wagons and track. </includedActivitiesStart>
        <includedActivitiesEnd xml:lang="en">The dataset ends with the service of transporting freight 1 metric ton.km. .

        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents the transport of one metric ton.km of freight in South Africa by a diesel locomotive. The dataset represents the entire transport life cycle, including the production and maintenance of the locomotive, production and maintenance of the goods wagons, the transportation of goods and the construction, operation, maintenance and disposal of railway track. The scope of this dataset is the operation of the locomotive, which has inputs of locomotive and goods wagon, maintenance (goods wagon and locomotive) and railway track via linking to global datasets, i.e. the infrastructure and maintenance datasets are not South African-specific.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Diesel consumption includes shunting and is calculated from total freight rail diesel usage (Transnet, 2017a) and total metric ton.kms transported using diesel locomotives (19% of total tonne.kms). The total metric ton.kms transported by diesel locomotives is calculated using the fuel efficiency (Transnet, 2017a) and the total tonne.kms of rail freight for 2017. Total metric ton.kms for general rail freight is reported directly (Transnet, 2017b), while metric ton.kms for iron ore and coal exports are calculated from the total tonnages transported (Transnet, 2017b) and the average transport distances. Transport distance is averaged for 2009, 2010 and 2011 for iron ore exports, and modelled by linear regression of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2016 data for coal exports (Transnet, 2016a; Transnet, 2011; Transnet, 2010). The diesel usage reported by Transnet is the total diesel use (including shunting). Thus the diesel use by diesel freight trains (including shunting) is taken to be the total diesel use reported by Transnet less an estimate of the diesel used for shunting electric locomotives. Diesel use for shunting is estimated at 19% of total diesel use (personal communication with Transnet), with the share of diesel use for shunting electric locomotives apportioned on the basis of metric ton.kms transported by electric locomotives (81% of total metric ton.kms). These figures represent all rail freight movements in South Africa. </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">Emissions of particulates, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) are calculated using emission factors from EcoTransIT (2016). South African locomotives are split into UIC I and UIC II emission classes based on the current locomotive fleet (Transnet, 2016b), with the assumption that only the new Class 43 diesel locomotives met UIC II emission standards (TransportWorldAfrica, 2012). The partitioning of particulate emissions into size classes is according to Spielmann et al. (2007). Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions are calculated from the sulphur content in local diesel (500 ppm (SAPIA, 2015)) and the assumption that all sulphur is emitted as sulphur dioxide. All other emissions to air are extrapolated on the basis of diesel consumption from the global dataset ("transport, freight train, diesel, GLO, 2004"), with the global dataset derived from data primarily of Swiss/European orgin, described in full in Spielmann et al. (2007). </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Locomotive production and maintenance are described in the individual global datasets. Locomotive demand per metric ton.km is calculated from the number of diesel freight locomotives (Transnet, 2016b) and the total metric ton.kms of freight transported by diesel locomotives (see above explanation on how this is calculated). A locomotive lifespan of 40 years is assumed (Spielmann et al., 2007). Goods wagon production and maintenance are described in the individual global datasets. Goods wagon demand per metric ton.km is calculated from the number of goods wagons (Transnet, 2016b) and the total metric ton.kms of freight moved annually by diesel locomotives (calculated as described above). A goods wagon lifespan of 40 years is assumed (Spielmann et al., 2007). The construction, operation, maintenance and disposal of railway track is described in the global dataset. Railway track demand per metric ton.km is calculated from the total length of two-way railway track (Transnet, 2016a), and the total metric ton.kms of diesel freight rail transport (calculated as described above).    </text>

        <comment xml:lang="en">NMVOC emissions are calculated from hydrocarbon emission factors for locomotives following UIC I and UIC II emissions standards available in EcoTransIT (2016) (g/kg diesel), corrected for methane emissions. It is assumed that 44% of South African locomotives meet non-regulated emission factors, while the remaining 56% meet UIC II emission standards (based on the tonne.kms transported by Class 43 diesel locomotives, as these are currently the only locomotives to meet UIC II emission standards in South Africa (TransportWorldAfrica, 2012). The tonne.kms transported by Class 43 versus other diesel locomotives is estimated from the number of Class 43 locomotives (Transnet (2016), the routes on which these locomotives operate (Creamer, 2012), the gross tonne.km performance of locomotives (Transnet, 2013; Transnet, 2017) and the ratio of gross to net tonn.kms (Transnet, 2017)). The breakdown of particulates into size fractions is based on the global dataset (transport, freight train, diesel, GLO, 2004), with the global dataset derived from datasets described in full in Spielmann et al. (2007).

        <comment xml:lang="en">Particulate emissions from both abrasion and fuel combustion are considered.  Particulate emissions from the abrasion of railway tracks, wheels, brakes and overhead lines (1.17E-5) are taken from Spielmann et al. (2007).                                                                                                                                                                                   Particulate emissions from diesel use are calculated from particulate emission factors for locomotives following non-regulated and UIC II emissions standards available in EcoTransIT (2016) (g/kg diesel). It is assumed that 44% of South African locomotives meet non-regulated emission factors, while the remaining 56% meet UIC II emission standards (based on the tonne.kms transported by Class 43 diesel locomotives, as these are currently the only locomotives to meet UIC II emission standards in South Africa (TransportWorldAfrica, 2012). The tonne.kms transported by Class 43 versus other diesel locomotives is estimated from the number of Class 43 locomotives (Transnet (2016), the routes on which these locomotives operate (Creamer, 2012), the gross tonne.km performance of locomotives (Transnet, 2013; Transnet, 2017) and the ratio of gross to net tonn.kms (Transnet, 2017)). The breakdown of particulates into size fractions is based on the global dataset (transport, freight train, diesel, GLO, 2004), with the global dataset derived from datasets described in full in Spielmann et al. (2007). In these datasets the particulate size distribution is assumed to match that of diesel locomotives without particulate filters, as presented by EU-Norm IIIa (Spielmann et al., 2007).
