          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset refers to the beneficiation and smelting activities in order to produce 1 kg of Scandium oxide (Sc2O3), with purity greater than 99.9% from rare earth tailings in the Bayan obo mines in the Baotou region of China. The rare earth tailings are produced as a byproduct from the mining and beneficiation activities of the REE-Nb-Fe ore at the same location. China is top producer of Scandium, being responsible for 90% of the global scandium production (Source: https://www.scandiummining.com/site/assets/files/5740/scandium-white-paperemc-website-june-2014-.pdf).</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Today, scandium is produced either as a co-product of other primary metal projects or is extracted out of old tailings from depleted mining projects where the specific process happened to concentrate scandium levels. (Source: https://www.scandiummining.com/scandium/scandium-faq/). This dataset is based on the publication of Wang et al (2020) (reference 1). The boundaries of the system have been expanded in order to include the processing of fluorite coarse ore that is produced as a byproduct during the scandium oxide production, due to the fact that there was no available proxy for the ore in Ecoinvent, The processing produces fluorite concentrate which was represented as fluorspar which exists in Ecoinvent. The data for the processing of fluorite was taken from Wang et al 2019 (reference 2 – consult the respective exchange comment).</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">Due to lack of data regarding the data acquisition time, the dataset generator has relied on the previous work of the same author that dealt with the production of scandium concentrate from the Bayan Obo tailings (see reference 2 –data coverage until the beneficiation stage). Wang et al 2019 mentions that the data were acquired during 2014-2018. Therefore, because the data is recent, the dataset is assumed valid from 2018 until 2022 (5 years). Furthermore, the electricity is taken from the grid, meaning that all upstream inputs and outputs are already taken into account. Finally, the steam is generated from coal burning. For further information, consult the sampling procedure and the individual exchange comments. </text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="8">This dataset includes the beneficiation stage and the smelting stage, including 5 major processes and 22 sub-processes. The first stage consists of 3 separation steps (i.e first separation, secondary separation, and final separation), during which scandium is separated and concentrated to produce Scandium (Sc) concentrate for the smelting stage. During the smelting stage – consisting of metallurgy and purification processes – Sc oxide is extracted from the concentrate to produce high-purity (&gt;99.9%) Sc2O3. </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="9">Beneficiation stage: The beneficiation stage is comprised of the first, secondary and final separation. During the first separation, the remaining iron and rare earth elements (REEs) are separated from the REE tailings, through the sub-processes of iron separation, REE separation). Afterwards, bulk flotation is applied to the remaining tailings, dividing them into mixed foam and mixed grit, in order to separate easily flotating and iron-silicate minerals and reduce the difficulty of the next recycling. The mixed foam separates fluorite and the mixed grit, containing approximately 0.02-0.03% scandium. Then the mix grit goes to the secondary separation (including the sub-processes of sulfur flotation (I), iron separation (II), gravity concentration, sulfur flotation (II), and Fe separation (III) in order to separate the sulfur and the remaining iron (byproducts) and thus further enrich the scandium. Sulfur flotation (I) and further iron separation is necessary in order to decrease the difficulty of Niobium (Nb) separation. Then gravity separation is performed in order to isolate the gangue materials from the grit, and simplify the Nb separation. At this point, the original tailings have been reduced to concentrates and Scandium-enriched remaining tailings (with 0.02-0.03% Sc content). The concentrates undergo again sulfur flotation (I) and iron separation (II) to further separate iron and sulfur and -as a result- further enrich the scandium in the remaining tailings, reaching a content of 0.03-0.04% Sc. After the first and secondary separation, iron, sulfur and REEs have been completely separated and the remaining valuable elements to be extracted from the tailings contain Nb and Sc. Nb separation is performed first, because of the Sc existence in silicate materials. Pyroxene and amphibole (silicate minerals) are recycled by a strong magnetic separation process and divided from the Nb tailings and gravity concentration tailings, producing high-quality Sc concentrates (approximately 0.05% Sc content). The concentrates are then fed to the smelting stage for the production of high purity Sc2O3.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="10">Smelting stage: The smelting stage consists of the metallurgy and the purification process. The metallurgy step incorporates the processes of concentration, ore grinding, and pressure filtration (physical extraction), normal acid leaching, pressure acid leaching, and extraction. The Sc concentrates produced from the beneficiation step are further concentrated and the residues are grinded  (particle size reach 200-325 mesh) to the output rate. Pressure filtration separates the solid and liquid containing Scandium. After that, (normal and pressurized) acid leaching is applied to extract the Scandium-containing substance (20-30% Sc content) from the acid leaching solution, which goes to the purification process, which includes 6 sub-processes: Ti cleaning, Fe cleaning, back extraction, purification, oxalic acid precipitation, and calcination. At first, residual titanium and iron are removed first to avoid impacting the further purification sub-processes. The ideal cleaning rate can be attained by applying high number of washing steps (i.e. 20). However too much washing can potentially lead to significant scandium losses. Then, the addition of sodium hydroxide within the Sc-containing solution produces a soda cake, containing Nb and Sc. Subsequently, niobium and scandium oxide are produced from filter cake and filtrate respectively, which are created through purification of the soda cake, after the addition of hydrochloric acid solution. Excessive addition of oxalic acid to the filtrate produces scandium oxalate precipitates, which are later burned at a temperature of 800°C in order to produce high-purity (&gt;99.9%) scandium oxide (Sc2O3).</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">Baotou is known as the rare earth capital of China. The mined ore from the Bayan Obo mines (located also in the Baotou region) is transported to the Baotou's rare earth processing facilities, which are located approximately 150 km south of Bayan Obo mines, where the majority of RE metals are produced as a byproduct of iron ore mining. Bayan Obo and Baotou are connected both by rail and road. Baotou is home to rare earth processing facilities and iron and steel refineries and for the production of various RE products such as carbonates, oxides, chlorides and different alloy products. The five rare earth separation and refining facilities have a total capacity of 73,500 tonnes per year.</text>

          <comment xml:lang="en">Oxygen content in the tailings is calculated as the sum of oxygen contents of each individual compound present in the rare earth tailings. The oxygen content in each compound is calculated by multiplying the amount of chemical compound content in the tailings with the subtotal mass of oxygen in the compound using the molecular weight calculator. (Source: &lt;https://www.lenntech.com/calculators/molecular/molecular-weight-calculator.htm&gt;). The oxygen content of each compound is provided on the properties comment field of the respective compound. For reasons explained in the comment section of the iron content, even though the iron content of FeO compound is not taken into account, the oxygen content is nevertheless considered. Feo content in the tailings is 2.38% and the subtotal mass of oxygen in that compound is 22.27%. In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings.

Environmental Impacts of Scandium Oxide Production from Rare Earths Tailings of Bayan Obo Mine. Journal of Cleaner Production, 122464. doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122464. The niobium concentrate produced as byproduct during scandium production contains 42.33% Nb2O5 (Source: Zhang, B., Xue, X., Huang, X., Yang, H., &amp; Chen, G. (2019). Study on recycling and leaching valuable elements from Bayan Obo tailings. Metall. Res. Technol., 116(1), 114. doi:10.1051/metal/2018040). The pyrochlore concentrate considered as a proxy contains 63% Nb2O5. The amount of pyrochlore concentrate has been adjusted in order to ensure that the same amount of Niobium comes out of the process. Mass percentage of niobium in Nb2O5 is 69.9%.

        <productionVolumeComment xml:lang="en">The global production volume of scandium oxide is between 15000 - 20000 kg (Source: https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-scandium.pdf). The average value of 17500 is considered here as representative amount of the global production. Furthermore, China is responsible for 90% of the global production of scandium (Source: https://www.scandiummining.com/site/assets/files/5740/scandium-white-paperemc-website-june-2014-.pdf). Therefore, the annual chinese production volume of scandium oxide is calculated by multiplying the percentage share of global scandium oxide production attributed to China (90%) with the aforementioned global average annual production of scandium oxide (17500 kg).

This amount is meant to be the sum of the amount of scandium tailings reported for scandium oxide production (10546.67 kg - given in Wang et al. 2020) and the amount of fluorite tailings produced by the concentration of fluorite (21776.67 kg - described in Wang et al. 2019).

The amount has been recalculated to ensure dry and wet mass leading to an overestimation of the reported amounts.

        <comment xml:lang="en">The presence of wastewater is acknowledged by the publication, on which this dataset is based (Wang, L., Wang, P., Chen, W.-Q., Wang, Q.-Q., &amp; Lu, H.-S. (2020). Environmental Impacts of Scandium Oxide Production from Rare Earths Tailings of Bayan Obo Mine. Journal of Cleaner Production, 122464. doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122464). Due to the water deficiency (water input: 753955.18 kg, (recycled) water output: 678106.66 kg, wastewater output: 3226.23 kg) and the absence of further data, it assumed that this water deficiency is covered from wastewater. Therefore, the wastewater amount is based on mass balance. </comment>

        <samplingProcedure xml:lang="en">This dataset is based on the following publication Wang, L., Wang, P., Chen, W.-Q., Wang, Q.-Q., &amp; Lu, H.-S. (2020). Environmental Impacts of Scandium Oxide Production from Rare Earths Tailings of Bayan Obo Mine. Journal of Cleaner Production, 122464. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122464. The analytical dataset can also be found on the supplementary materials of the abovementioned publication (Table S4, pages S4 &amp; S5). Individual exchanges that were not present within the Ecoinvent database have been modeled with assuming proxies.

Additionally, data concerning the production of fluorite concentrate, which is produced from a byproduct of the bulk flotation step, was taken from Wang, L., Jiao, G. H., Lu, H. S., Wang, Q. Q. (2019). Life cycle assessment of integrated exploitation technology for tailings in Bayan Obo mine, China. APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH 17(2):4343-4359. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1702_43434359. This was done to ensure the proper integration of the dataset to the database, as there was no suitable proxy for the fluorite coarse ore in the database (which is a byproduct of the scandium production process).

Unit conversion has been performed to some exchanges to match the unit of the foreground data with the unit of the representative process of Ecoinvent. More detailed info is provided on the individual general comment of each exchange. Infrastructural input (i.e chemical factory) has been introduced to take into account the type of infrastructure used in order to produce scandium oxide. This infrastructural input was not present on the original dataset and is added in order to comply with the requirements of the Ecoinvent database. Wastewater and tailings are calculated based on dry and wet mass balance, leading to an overestimation of the reported amounts. For more information, consult the individual exchange comments. Recycled water (byproduct of the production process) has also been considered (consult the tap water exchange comment). According to the supplementary materials of Wang et al (2020), the electricity originates from the grid, meaning that all upstream inputs and outputs are already taken into account and the steam is generated from coal burning. </samplingProcedure>
        <extrapolations xml:lang="en">Proxies were considered in the place of specific exchanges, which were not available in the Ecoinvent database. Furthermore, an infrastructure input was considered to comply with the Ecoinvent database guidelines (for more information see the comment section of each exchange). In addition, the composition of the rare earth tailings is taken from Table 2 of the following publication: Zhang, B., Xue, X., Huang, X., Yang, H., &amp; Chen, G. (2019).  In the abovementioned publication, neither data on the water content of the tailings are available, nor specific water loss during roasting is reported. For that reason, the reported elemental contents of the rare earth tailings (i.e properties) refer to the dry mass of the tailings and therefore it assumed that the water content of the rare earth tailings is zero.</extrapolations>
