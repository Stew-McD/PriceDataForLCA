The dataset doesn't include the purification and the use of the gas for co-generation. The dataset also doesn't include emissions from the gasholder, because they are fed back to the biogas. It's assumed that in the digestion process and storage of biogas no emissions occur.</includedActivitiesEnd>
        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The dataset represents a multioutput process and describes a bio-refinery (grass-refinery) that delivers three co-products: biogas, proteins and fibres. Grass input is assumed to have a carbon content of 45%. The required process energy (heat for grass-pre-treatment and drying of fibres and proteins and electricity for fibre presses, fans, blowers reception bells etc.) is obtained from conventional energy carriers and not from the use of biogas. For infrastructure expenditures, the same infrastructure as for bio-ethanol production from grass is used as a first approximation.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">A bio-refinery is a technical concept for whole crop utilisation. It applies fractionation to separate different quantities from the raw material and thereby aiming to optimise the value added. In Switzerland, a grass-refinery plant was in operation between January 2001 and summer 2003 in Schaffhausen. A comprehensive grass-refinery process, as shown in the figure below, was designed to produce three products: biogas, fibres and proteins.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Potential products and their application are briefly described:</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">a. Grass fibres</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="5">Grass fibres can be recovered at a length of 2-30 mm. Variation is due to raw material variation and process conditions. Grass fibres are suitable and competitive for short fibre applications. The following products can be made from grass fibres:</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="6">• Insulation products.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="7">o Insulation boards can be produced in a density range between 60 and 160 kg/m3. The heat conductivity is 0.04-0.045 W/mK, depending on the density of the board. Resistance against fire and fungi can be achieved using additives. Advantages compared with mineral wool include the high specific heat capacity, which results in a 10-12 hours delayed release of outside heat to the inside and improved summer heat protection.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="8">Boards can be used for thermal insulation in ventilated facades and cavity masonry, steep-pitched roofs, over rafters and for sound insulation. Possible applications of grass-based insulation boards cover around 80% of all insulation applications.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="9">o Blow-in insulation is successful at a blow-in density of 55-60 kg/m3. The heat conductivity</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="10">is 0.04 W/mK. Resistance against fire and fungi can be achieved by using additives. Quality control must include settling properties. Blow-in insulation is an industrial standard in many countries and makes about 1.4% of the total insulation volume in Germany.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="11">• Natural fibre re-enforced plastic: specifications include filling grade and mechanical properties.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="12">• Paper: specifications include colour and mechanical properties.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="13">• Combustion pellets: specifications include mechanical stability, levels of ash, nitrogen, and sulphur content and ash melting point. To reduce the ash content, low or medium-quality grass</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="14">requires washing.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="15">None</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="16">b. Grass protein</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="17">The value of grass as a ruminant feed is based on its raw protein content. Separation of the protein fraction from the cell wall components opens marketing opportunities for non-ruminants, e.g. pigs and hens. Juice pressed from silage grass has been fed successfully to pigs and piglets. A dried protein product from fresh grass contains around 40% raw protein, 10% raw fat and 15% raw ash, depending on raw material quality and processing conditions. The high methionine content of grass protein makes it particularly suited to laying hens. However, protein extraction and drying are significant cost factors.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="18">None</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="19">c.Biogas</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="20">The water-soluble fraction of good-quality grass yields 200-250 m3 biogas per tonne of dry matter.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="21">Utilisation of biogas includes combustion in a combined heat and power machine, as well as feeding into the natural gas distribution network or gas fuelling stations (after purification and compression).</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="22">The grass-refinery process is designed in such a way that it can be optimised according to specific aims (fractionation). This can be the fibre recovery at a specific length distribution profile, or the extraction of proteins, or the optimised recovery of soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) for biogas production.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="23">During operation the plant demonstrated the general feasibility of producing technical fibres and biogas (Grass 2004). The technical fibres were further processed on-site for production of a blow-in insulation product. Biogas was utilised in a combined heat and power plant. Heat was used internally for drying fibres. In order to make the entire refinery profitable, it was planned to certify and offer the generated power under the label 'Naturemade Star'.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="24">Production of proteins was planned to be added as a further step. The plant, however, was shut down before the required processes for the generation of proteins were implemented. The reasons for shutting down were manifold32:</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="25">• Technical teething trouble: e.g. the capacity of grass scrubber was not sufficient to cope with</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="26">unexpected high shares (up to 20%) of polluting materials such as sand and stones. Consequently the scrubber had to be re-sized and replaced. Also, the actual capacity of the drier did not match its specification.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="27">• Unexpected labour costs due to more staff required for packaging of products.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="28">• Changing business environment: Exit of bank investor</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="29">• Decreasing engagement of project promoters</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="30">In order to account for the fact that the described process produces three products, a multi-output</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="31">process is set up.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="32">The plant was designed for a raw material throughput capacity around 0.8 tonnes of dry matter per hour. Literature reports that a yearly input of 4400 tDM of grass (dry matter) was expected. Literature also says that the yield of technical fibres was 500-600 kg per tonne of dry matter and the biogas yield was 150-250 Nm3, depending on raw material quality. Additional production volumes are given in literature.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="33">In the table bellow the yields of the three products as reported in different sources are summarised.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="35">Biogas is digested in a digestion tank. In Schaffhausen, an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor design for biogas production from the water-soluble extracts of grass has been adapted. This reactor design is widely applied in breweries, the sugar industry and various other industries. High-rate anaerobic reactors, such as UASB reactors offer advantages for soluble substrates and larger-scale applications. They also offer scale-up advantages for bio-refinery systems applying solid/liquid separation.</text>

        <comment xml:lang="en">The dataset as presented in this study is based on the assumption that the biogas is upgraded and used as a fuel.

Some properties of biogas generated from grass and grass-silage as applied in this project are summarised:

Methane - 55% of the volume
Carbon Dioxide - 45% of the volume
Hydrogen Sulfide - 80 ppm
Density - 1.28 kg/Nm3
Lower Heating Value - 19.74 MJ/Nm3 
Upper heating Value - 21.85 MJ/Nm3

The relatively high share of CO2 in the generated biogas is a consequence of feeding the biogas with emissions of the gasholder. These emissions are characterised by a high share of CO2.

        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated value, based on literature.

Electricity is required for operation of various devices, such as grass reception belts, hexler, comminutor, fibre press, decanter, fans, blowers, juice recycle pumps, pelletiser. In literature, a total electricity consumption of 205 kWh/tgrassDM is reported. It should be noted that in contrast to other digestion processes as described in this chapter, no agitation of the input substance while staying in the biogas reactor is required.
Similar as for bio waste digestion, various concepts of energy supply for the digestion of sewage sludge are possible. In principle, if biogas is used as a fuel for co-generation, the heat expenditures can usually covered completely, and electricity demand can be covered partly by the produced heat and electricity from on-site co-generation. However, this would result in a lower process efficiency of the digestion process; i.e. ideally an adjustment with respect to the final yield of biogas is performed. On the other hand, if biogas is assumed to be used as a feedstock for transportation fuels, the process most likely would be optimised in a way that a maximum yield of biogas is achieved. The reason for this is that a higher biogas throughput in the biogas upgrading plant significantly reduces the cost for the biogas upgrading. In case that all biogas is fed in the upgrading plant, the required heat and electricity is obtained from conventional energy carriers.
For electricity the current Swiss supply mix is employed.</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated value, based on literature.

Heating is required for the pre-treatment of the grass, and post treatment (drying) of fibres and proteins.
It's assumed that the pre-treatment stage should be the same as for the ethanol production from grass.
For ethanol, literature gives that the steam consumption for the pre-treatment stage is 5.1 MJ/litre of ethanol, and the electricity consumption 0.5 kWh/l (while the consumption of grass is 32.7 kg of fresh grass per litre of ethanol). Based on these figures, a specific heating value of 0.96 MJ/kgGrass_DM was calculated. 
Digestion takes place at the end of the refinery process, and hence the input substance (grass juice) has already achieved the required digestion temperature.
For post treatment of proteins and fibres, specific heat consumptions for fibres drying and protein drying of 2.50 MJ/kg evarporated water and 4.01 MJ/kg evarporated water, respectively are assumed.
Similar as for biowaste digestion, various concepts of energy supply for the digestion of sewage sludge are possible. In principle, if biogas is used as a fuel for co-generation, the heat expenditures can usually covered completely, and electricity demand can be covered partly by the produced heat and electricity from on-site co-generation. However, this would result in a lower process efficiency of the digestion process; i.e. ideally an adjustment with respect to the final yield of biogas is performed. On the other hand, if biogas is assumed to be used as a feedstock for transportation fuels, the process most likely would be optimised in a way that a maximum yield of biogas is achieved. The reason for this is that a higher biogas throughput in the biogas upgrading plant significantly reduces the cost for the biogas upgrading. In case that all biogas is fed in the upgrading plant, the required heat and electricity is obtained from conventional energy carriers.
For heat supply various options are possible. In this study we assume that the heat demand is covered by natural gas combustion. Alternatively also wood chips may be used.
