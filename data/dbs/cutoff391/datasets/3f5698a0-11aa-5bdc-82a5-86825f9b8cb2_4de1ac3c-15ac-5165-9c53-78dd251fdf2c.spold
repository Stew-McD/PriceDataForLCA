        <productionVolumeComment xml:lang="en">Estimated value. The global production volume is extrapolated from the European production volume based on reports from Cefic (European Chemical Industry Council), and the American Chemistry Council.  
According to Cefic (2016a) the global sales of chemicals in the year 2015 was 3 534 billion euros. The reported share of sales per region are: EU28 14.7%; Other Europe (Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Russia and Ukraine) 2.7%; NAFTA (US, Canada and Mexico) 16.5%; Latin America 3.8%; China 39.9%; Japan 3.9%; Republic of Korea 3.2%; India 2.2%; Rest of Asia 11.9%; Rest of the World 1.3%. Cefic also reports the US total sales, which amount to 518.7 billion euros out of the global 3 534 billion euros (14.7%). The same share is reported by the American Chemistry Council (2016), according to which the USA sales account for 15% of global sales for the year 2016. 
European production volume:
Estimated value based on assumptions relevant to production volumes of similar products. This estimation is heavily based on expert jugdement mostly due to withheld and confidential data for similiar products of 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-dihydroperoxide. According to the European Chemical Agency, the consumption of OO-tert-butyl O-(2-ethylhexyl) peroxycarbonate and Dibenzoyl peroxide for the year of 2016 is estimated to be 5500000 kg. The aforementioned value is the average of the range given in the literature. According to the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic, 2016a), the total sales of chemicals of the European Union in 2016 amounted to 519 billion euros. Chemical imports were valued at 91 billion euros for the first 11 months of 2016. Based on this, the value for the total imports for the year 2016 was extrapolated, yielding a value of 99.3 billion euros. Furthermore, Cefic (2016b) reports a trade surplus (exports-imports) of 46.4 billion euros (once again extrapolated for the whole year using the value of 42 billion euros for the first 11 months of 2016). Considering all the aforementioned information, the total chemical consumption in the EU is calculated to be 472.6 billion euros (total sales-exports+imports). It is therefore calculated that production is 110% of consumption. This value is used to scale the information on chemical consumption to production. The European production volume is therefore 6050000 kg. Since no data were found for the global production this value was scaled accordingly.

        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated based on literature data published by the industry. For this activity, no information was readily available concerning infrastructure and land-use. Therefore, the infrastructure is estimated based on data from two chemical factories, the BASF site of Ludwigshafen and the chemical factory in Gendorf (which are both located in Germany), which produce a wide range of chemical substances. Based on this data, the following assumptions are made: the built area amounts to about 4.2 ha, the plant has an average output of 50'000 t/a and a lifespan of fifty years. The estimated infrastructure amount is therefore 4.00 E-10 units per kg of produced chemical.

The amount of electricity per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of electricity consumed in the year 2015 was 3498800 GJ (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of electricity is 0.406 kWh/kg (year 2015) of chemical substance produced. The 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.416 kWh/kg (1.5 MJ/kg). Cross-reference: the amount of chemicals produced (excluding intermediate products) in the EU-28 in the year 2011 was 327 million tonnes (Eurostat, http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Chemicals_production_statistics, accessed 20170126). The chemical and petrochemical industry sector consumed 2.33 EJ of energy in 2011 (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2014, BAT on Common Waste water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector). The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for.</comment>

The resulting energy (both heat and electricity) consumed per kg of chemicals produced in 2011 is thus 7.13 MJ/kg. This is higher than the value calculated using data published by Gendorf – 3.85 MJ/kg, but that is to be expected as the intermediate products are not accounted for. </comment>

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of nitrogen used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The reported amount of nitrogen used in 2015 was 33512400 Nm3 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). One Nm3 of nitrogen is equal to 1.2506 kg. The resulting amount of nitrogen - the 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.019 kg/kg. Nitrogen is mainly used during the production of chemicals for 'blanketing', which is the process of applying gas to the vapour space of a container or vessel in order to control its composition.</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated based on literature data published by the industry. This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of nitrogen used per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The reported amount of nitrogen used in 2015 was 33512400 Nm3 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). One Nm3 of nitrogen is equal to 1.2506 kg. The resulting amount of nitrogen - the 5-year average (2011 - 2015, weighted by production volume) is 0.019 kg/kg. Nitrogen is mainly used during the production of chemicals for 'blanketing', which is the process of applying gas to the vapour space of a container or vessel in order to control its composition.</comment>

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of wastewater (which is later on treated in the municipal WWTP) per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of wastewater which is later on treated in the municipal WWTP in the year 2015 was 1200 tonnes (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The resulting amount of wastewater is 2.7E-06 m3/kg of chemical product produced.</comment>

        <comment xml:lang="en">Calculated to ensure the water balance. In general, in the case of recirculating cooling systems, 77% of the water input evaporates to air. In case of once-through cooling systems, 4% of the water input evaporates to air. The process water has in the chemical industry an average evaporation rate of 20.5%. In the specific case of the Gendorf factory, the calculated evaporation rate based on the data published is 6.3%. This matches the qualitative information, that the majority of the cooling systems in Gendorf are once-through and that the amount of cooling water used is significantly higher than the amount of process water used (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).</comment>

This value is a 5-year average of data (2011 - 2015) published by the Gendorf factory (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2015, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de),  (Gendorf, 2014, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de). The amount of groundwater and surface water (river) extracted per kg of chemical substance produced is calculated using literature data published by the Gendorf factory based in Germany, which produces a wide range of chemical substances. The factory produced 1657400 tonnes of chemical substances in the year 2015 (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de) and 740000 tonnes of intermediate products. The amount of groundwater and surface water (river) extracted in the year 2015 was 19950000 tonnes and 21488100 tonnes respectively (Gendorf, 2016, Umwelterklärung, www.gendorf.de).</comment>

- The input exchange 'dimethyl hexanediol' does not have an activity link and therefore requires a market for that input to be available. If the market is not available the dataset will be put on hold at the end of its review and will remain on hold until such a market has been accepted into the ecoinvent database.
