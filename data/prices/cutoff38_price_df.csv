0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

From IEA. In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh. Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).

143.0;EUR2005;Calculated value based on estimates and literature. The price of the batterry is 32.06euro/kg. The weight of a battery for an electric scooter is 30kg (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed 20130726). The market price for an electric scooter is approximatelly 4600euro (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed: 20130726). It is estimated, that the basic price is 1/3 lower than the market price (expert judgement). The basic price of a scooter without batterry is then calculated to be ((4600*2/3)-(32.06*30)=) 2105euro. The ratio between the price of powertrain and glider in case of electric cars is 1:17 (for more details see the comment field of these products' prices). The resulting prices are 8.4euro/kg of glider, for electric scooter and 142euro/kg of powertrain, for electric scooter. The price is considered to be the same (142euro/kg) for all the parts of the powertrain, such as motor, controller and charger.;bbd1420d-2c93-45f3-bda3-73ef11d0c3dc;market for charger, for electric scooter;GLO

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;525254ec-0119-4003-b3ae-a700eefff925;market for shavings, hardwood, measured as dry mass;CH

Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;ae13f419-fa76-4878-ab68-5bb94d3e24e6;market for electricity, low voltage, renewable energy products;CH

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh. Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;525254ec-0119-4003-b3ae-a700eefff925;suction, shavings, hardwood;RoW

Following this assumption the price of the crust from Parkes process for lead production is calculated to be ((0.03292*1*0.376)/(0.008-0.03292*0.008)=) 1.589 Euro.;b1489e93-5758-49fb-979e-455555779aec;market for crust from Parkes process for lead production;GLO

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;525254ec-0119-4003-b3ae-a700eefff925;suction, shavings, hardwood;Europe without Switzerland

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;ff7a13da-3665-469e-a211-4ab06801c7ea;suction, shavings, softwood;RoW

It is estimated, that the market price=basic price + basic price*0.4. The total value (basic price) of the powertrain (21000/(1+0.4)=) 16150 euro is divided between the separate parts of the power train by their weight. The resulting price per kilogram is thus assumed to be the same for all the different parts of the power train (inverter, charger, motor, converter, etc.).;9fdc557e-85d0-4b26-8cfb-24c7205f6f3a;market for powertrain, for electric passenger car;GLO

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;ff7a13da-3665-469e-a211-4ab06801c7ea;market for shavings, softwood, measured as dry mass;Europe without Switzerland

The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh. Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;525254ec-0119-4003-b3ae-a700eefff925;suction, shavings, hardwood;CA-QC
