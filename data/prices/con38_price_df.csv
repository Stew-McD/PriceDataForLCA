Agricultural outlook. (http://www.fapri.missouri.edu/outreach/publications/ag_outlook.asp?current_page=outreach; accessed 22/06/10). Unit conversion from US gallon to kg - 1 gallon = 3.7856 liter * 0.789 kg/liter (ethanol density) = 2.9868 kg). When producing 0.30638kg of ethanol, without water, in 95% solution state, from fermentation, 0.32067kg of Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles is produced as a by-product.

The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;525254ec-0119-4003-b3ae-a700eefff925;market for shavings, hardwood, measured as dry mass;RoW

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;c5651546-a49e-4c1d-b856-1cf358ab466a;suction, shavings, hardwood;CH

The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;c5651546-a49e-4c1d-b856-1cf358ab466a;suction, shavings, hardwood;CA-QC

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;ff7a13da-3665-469e-a211-4ab06801c7ea;market for shavings, softwood, measured as dry mass;RoW

143.0;EUR2005;Calculated value based on estimates and literature. The price of the batterry is 32.06euro/kg. The weight of a battery for an electric scooter is 30kg (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed 20130726). The market price for an electric scooter is approximatelly 4600euro (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed: 20130726). It is estimated, that the basic price is 1/3 lower than the market price (expert judgement). The basic price of a scooter without batterry is then calculated to be ((4600*2/3)-(32.06*30)=) 2105euro. The ratio between the price of powertrain and glider in case of electric cars is 1:17 (for more details see the comment field of these products' prices). The resulting prices are 8.4euro/kg of glider, for electric scooter and 142euro/kg of powertrain, for electric scooter. The price is considered to be the same (142euro/kg) for all the parts of the powertrain, such as motor, controller and charger.;8f5d26e5-ea22-432f-93e5-362a6df5ec66;powertrain production, for electric scooter;GLO

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;aa447135-9cc5-4f34-9385-ca2a0ae70d3c;suction, shavings, softwood;CA-QC

The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;c5651546-a49e-4c1d-b856-1cf358ab466a;planing, beam, hardwood, u=10%;RoW

0.077;EUR2005;"Expert judgement (Urs Luginbühl, Swiss Sawmilling industry, personal communication in June 2014). Cross-reference; FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.";ec25a8e0-8a4a-4fb7-ad61-8302b7744a82;market for slab and siding, hardwood, wet, measured as dry mass;CH

It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.";ec25a8e0-8a4a-4fb7-ad61-8302b7744a82;market for slab and siding, hardwood, wet, measured as dry mass;Europe without Switzerland

The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;aa447135-9cc5-4f34-9385-ca2a0ae70d3c;planing, lath, softwood, u=20%;CA-QC
