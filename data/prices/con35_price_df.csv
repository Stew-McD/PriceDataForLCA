187.0;EUR2005;Calculated value based on estimates and literature. The price of the batterry is 32.06euro/kg. The weight of a battery for an electric scooter is 30kg (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed 20130726). The market price for an electric scooter is approximatelly 4600euro (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed: 20130726). It is estimated, that the basic price is 1/3 lower than the market price (expert judgement). The basic price of a scooter without batterry is then calculated to be ((4600*2/3)-(32.06*30)=) 2105euro. The ratio between the price of powertrain and glider in case of electric cars is 1:17 (for more details see the comment field of these products' prices). The resulting prices are 8.4euro/kg of glider, for electric scooter and 142euro/kg of powertrain, for electric scooter.

187.0;EUR2005;Calculated value based on estimates and literature. The price of the batterry is 32.06euro/kg. The weight of a battery for an electric scooter is 30kg (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed 20130726). The market price for an electric scooter is approximatelly 4600euro (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed: 20130726). It is estimated, that the basic price is 1/3 lower than the market price (expert judgement). The basic price of a scooter without batterry is then calculated to be ((4600*2/3)-(32.06*30)=) 2105euro. The ratio between the price of powertrain and glider in case of electric cars is 1:17 (for more details see the comment field of these products' prices). The resulting prices are 8.4euro/kg of glider, for electric scooter and 142euro/kg of powertrain, for electric scooter. The price is considered to be the same (142euro/kg) for all the parts of the powertrain, such as motor, controller and charger.;9fdc557e-85d0-4b26-8cfb-24c7205f6f3a;market for powertrain, for electric passenger car;GLO

In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;market for electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only;KR

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;treatment of residue from mechanical treatment, desktop computer, municipal waste incineration;RoW

The producer states, that the price of a power train is around 21000 euro (Bursa, http://www.brusa.biz/fileadmin/Diverses/Download/Flyer/Flyer_Drivetrain_Sets_inkl_Preis.pdf, accessed 20130725). It is estimated, that the market price=basic price + basic price*0.4. The total value (basic price) of the powertrain (21000/(1+0.4)=) 16150 euro is divided between the separate parts of the power train by their weight. The resulting price per kilogram is thus assumed to be the same for all the different parts of the power train (inverter, charger, motor, converter, etc.).;3b02c7eb-5df6-46ad-a39d-51c588aa75dc;market for electric motor, electric passenger car;GLO

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).

0.1;EUR2005;Temporary price data. Calculated as 90% of purchasers price based on: Price for industrial users from IEA Key world energy statistics 2004 (www.iea.org). In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;market for electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only;RU
