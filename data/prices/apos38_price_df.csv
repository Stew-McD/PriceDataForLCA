0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;aa447135-9cc5-4f34-9385-ca2a0ae70d3c;planing, lath, softwood, u=20%;CA-QC

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005.

6.75;EUR2005;"For lithium, there is no exchange trading, no terminal storage market and only an extremely limited spot market (Reuters, 2016). The lithium price is negotiated bilateral and based on customer specifications with price information rarely publicly documented (European Lithium, 2017). Roskill Information Services estimate the price for technical grade lithium carbonate in 2017 between 6900 and 7800 USD per tonne, with a price premium of 500 USD for battery grade lithium (European Lithium, 2017). USGS estimates the price for lithium carbonate, battery grade, to be 7400USD in 2016 (USGS, 2017). Here an average price of 7500 USD per tonne lithium carbonate is assumed, average exchange rate 1 USD = 0.9 EUR in 2017 (Oanda, 2017). Resulting in a price for lithium carbonate of 6.75EUR/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh. Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).

Monetary supply: (1.6E11 EUR). Value of metal input to activities: 1.2E11 EUR. 4.4E10 (=(1.6-1.2) E11) was then considered as the price of the metal processing.  The monetary flow was distributed over the Ecoinvent metal processing processes. 'Chipless shaping' and 'Chipping' acounted for 86.5 % of the production volumes and 86.5% of the monetary flow was therefore ascribed to these processe. The rest of the monetary flow was ascribed to the remaining metal processing processes. Within the last categories the money flow was ditributed between the different processes on basis of their respective electricity consumption, because many of the processes not had mass units.;cdb7b939-f508-49ed-80f3-b39f6137fe1c;wire drawing, copper;RoW

In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh. Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).

The economic allocation factor in eiv2.2 was 98.837% for ethanol and 1.163% for Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles. Following this assumption the price of the Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles is calculated to be ((0.01163*0.324*0.30638)/(0.32067-0.01163*0.32067)=) 0.003643 Euro.";784742e8-9297-43ce-a6eb-4cf891661322;ethanol production from rye;RoW

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;ff7a13da-3665-469e-a211-4ab06801c7ea;market for shavings, softwood, measured as dry mass;Europe without Switzerland

187.0;EUR2005;Calculated based on assumptions and data from the producer. The producer states, that the price of a power train is around 21000 euro (Bursa, http://www.brusa.biz/fileadmin/Diverses/Download/Flyer/Flyer_Drivetrain_Sets_inkl_Preis.pdf, accessed 20130725). It is estimated, that the market price=basic price + basic price*0.4. The total value (basic price) of the powertrain (21000/(1+0.4)=) 16150 euro is divided between the separate parts of the power train by their weight. The resulting price per kilogram is thus assumed to be the same for all the different parts of the power train (inverter, charger, motor, converter, etc.).;ce201c12-f12f-4e7e-aa4a-7ddcf8353f69;market for charger, electric passenger car;GLO

6.75;EUR2005;"For lithium, there is no exchange trading, no terminal storage market and only an extremely limited spot market (Reuters, 2016). The lithium price is negotiated bilateral and based on customer specifications with price information rarely publicly documented (European Lithium, 2017). Roskill Information Services estimate the price for technical grade lithium carbonate in 2017 between 6900 and 7800 USD per tonne, with a price premium of 500 USD for battery grade lithium (European Lithium, 2017). USGS estimates the price for lithium carbonate, battery grade, to be 7400USD in 2016 (USGS, 2017). Here an average price of 7500 USD per tonne lithium carbonate is assumed, average exchange rate 1 USD = 0.9 EUR in 2017 (Oanda, 2017). Resulting in a price for lithium carbonate of 6.75EUR/kg.

0.113;EUR2005;Calculated based on data from FAOSTAT (accessed 20140429). The price is calculated by using data on total world import quantity (m3) and import value (1000 USD), year 2005. 40461924 m3 of Chips and Particles was imported in the world in 2005. The import value was 3022227000 USD. The calculated price is thus (3022227000/40461924=74.7*0.8=) 62.2 Euro/m3. It is estimated, that the chips and particles are half hardwood (of density 650 kg/m3) and half softwood (of density 450 kg/m3), thus the remaining mixture has a density of 550 kg/m3. The recalculated price is (1/550*62.2=) 0.11 Euro/kg. Using the same approach the calculated price for 2010 was 0.123 Euro/kg.;c5651546-a49e-4c1d-b856-1cf358ab466a;market for shavings, hardwood, loose, measured as dry mass;GLO
