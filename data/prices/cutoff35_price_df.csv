In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;market for electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only;DK

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).

187.0;EUR2005;Calculated value based on estimates and literature. The price of the batterry is 32.06euro/kg. The weight of a battery for an electric scooter is 30kg (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed 20130726). The market price for an electric scooter is approximatelly 4600euro (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed: 20130726). It is estimated, that the basic price is 1/3 lower than the market price (expert judgement). The basic price of a scooter without batterry is then calculated to be ((4600*2/3)-(32.06*30)=) 2105euro. The ratio between the price of powertrain and glider in case of electric cars is 1:17 (for more details see the comment field of these products' prices). The resulting prices are 8.4euro/kg of glider, for electric scooter and 142euro/kg of powertrain, for electric scooter. The price is considered to be the same (142euro/kg) for all the parts of the powertrain, such as motor, controller and charger.;ce201c12-f12f-4e7e-aa4a-7ddcf8353f69;market for charger, electric passenger car;GLO

In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;treatment of waste rubber, unspecified, municipal incineration;Europe without Switzerland

0.308;EUR2005;The prices of metal processing processes were calculated by using the monetary flows (deducted the price of metal inputs) from the following metal processing activities in EU & DK IO database: 61, 62, 63 and 64. Monetary supply: (1.6E11 EUR). Value of metal input to activities: 1.2E11 EUR. 4.4E10 (=(1.6-1.2) E11) was then considered as the price of the metal processing.  The monetary flow was distributed over the Ecoinvent metal processing processes. 'Chipless shaping' and 'Chipping' acounted for 86.5 % of the production volumes and 86.5% of the monetary flow was therefore ascribed to these processe. The rest of the monetary flow was ascribed to the remaining metal processing processes. Within the last categories the money flow was ditributed between the different processes on basis of their respective electricity consumption, because many of the processes not had mass units.;cdb7b939-f508-49ed-80f3-b39f6137fe1c;wire drawing, copper;RoW

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;treatment of municipal solid waste, incineration;LU

It is estimated, that the market price=basic price + basic price*0.4. The total value (basic price) of the powertrain (21000/(1+0.4)=) 16150 euro is divided between the separate parts of the power train by their weight. The resulting price per kilogram is thus assumed to be the same for all the different parts of the power train (inverter, charger, motor, converter, etc.).;faac50ba-db79-4c84-8c68-9453728f9063;electric motor production, vehicle;RER

In addition, regarding label-certified electricity, the Swiss government has a market instrument for renewable energy which is calculated as the difference between the market price and the production price. This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de). Therefore, the production price of label certified energy is assumed to be the supplyer price plus the 0.45Rp/kWh.The unit conversion from CH to EUR is based on the ecoinvent unit conversion file (1 CHF2005 = 0.644 EUR2005).;637ee275-a239-4dcb-b084-abfa110dd65b;market for electricity, for reuse in municipal waste incineration only;CH

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).

This was started in 2009 and is 0.45 Rp/kWh (http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00612/02073/index.html?lang=de).

187.0;EUR2005;Calculated value based on estimates and literature. The price of the batterry is 32.06euro/kg. The weight of a battery for an electric scooter is 30kg (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed 20130726). The market price for an electric scooter is approximatelly 4600euro (producer's information: http://vespino.ch/?page_id=6, accessed: 20130726). It is estimated, that the basic price is 1/3 lower than the market price (expert judgement). The basic price of a scooter without batterry is then calculated to be ((4600*2/3)-(32.06*30)=) 2105euro. The ratio between the price of powertrain and glider in case of electric cars is 1:17 (for more details see the comment field of these products' prices). The resulting prices are 8.4euro/kg of glider, for electric scooter and 142euro/kg of powertrain, for electric scooter. The price is considered to be the same (142euro/kg) for all the parts of the powertrain, such as motor, controller and charger.;9fdc557e-85d0-4b26-8cfb-24c7205f6f3a;market for powertrain, for electric passenger car;GLO

187.0;EUR2005;Calculated based on assumptions and data from the producer. The producer states, that the price of a power train is around 21000 euro (Bursa, http://www.brusa.biz/fileadmin/Diverses/Download/Flyer/Flyer_Drivetrain_Sets_inkl_Preis.pdf, accessed 20130725). It is estimated, that the market price=basic price + basic price*0.4. The total value (basic price) of the powertrain (21000/(1+0.4)=) 16150 euro is divided between the separate parts of the power train by their weight. The resulting price per kilogram is thus assumed to be the same for all the different parts of the power train (inverter, charger, motor, converter, etc.).;3b02c7eb-5df6-46ad-a39d-51c588aa75dc;market for electric motor, electric passenger car;GLO
